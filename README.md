# Data-Mining-and-Predictive-Analytics
Exploratory and Predictive Analytics of Airbnb listings to yield high booking rate

# Project Purpose -
This project had two parts. The first part was a Kaggle Competition. This competition was held between various groups within the class. The first part of the project used the Airbnb data from all the markets in the United States. The second part of the project focused on specific market in the US and on creating a business case for the market. We were expected to demonstrate our ability to ask good questions and form hypothesis, build and select models that were suitable for analyzing market specific data, interpret the results and use them to guide decision making process of an investor.

# Part 1 - Kaggle Competition 
The Kaggle Competition ran till the end of the semester. We were provided with Airbnb Train data with 150k listings data and 66 variables. The outcome variable to predict was high_booking_rate, which shows whether an Airbnb listing has a higher booking rate or not. We were also provided with test data and a data dictionary that explained all the variables. The performance of the model we built was evaluated using Area Under Curve. Submissions were restricted to one per day and the best submssion of each team were used for the leaderboard.

The emphasis of the competition was to only use variables that we can explain in the model. Our feature engineering process was focused more on the use of domain knowledge than just using a combinatorial approach to variables to get a higher accuracy. We were competing for business analytics, not for math.

# Part 2 - Business Case Development

For this part we were assigned a specific market. It was Las Vegas for my team. We were expected to start with market research, asking questions and answering them. This part was a mix of business case development and statistical modeling. With some knowledge gained from the model that we built in the Kaggle part, we built a Las Vegas specific model. In essence, our goal was to ask questions, answer them using a mix of modeling and market research, and repeat the cycle.

We developed a business case for an investor who wanted to buy homes and market them as Airbnb Rentals. Needless to state, the investor would like to buy homes that will achieve higher bookin rate. Investor would want to price and manage them in a way to achieve higher booking rate. Our focus was on helping investor with the initial acquisition on the home. To help him figure out the best type of property to buy. We later focused on giving recommendations that would help him effectively manage the property as an airbnb rental and get high bookin rate.

If by now you are intrigued enough, I would love for you to take a look at our final presentation uploaded in this repository as well as our final report that has all the details about our data cleaning process, data exploration and predictive modeling. Thanks :)
